            "content": "AP Literature &amp; Composition: Weekly Participation Assignments . This week in AP Literature and Composition, I gained more experience on analyzing characters and understanding their meaning to the bigger picture of the story. We annotated four short stories, all covering topics that relate to bigger issues in society and people that represent diverse people of the world. Such as in the short story, “The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allan Poe, Poe utilizes first person point of view to represent the thought process of a psychopath, while not justifying his actions. By using descriptive language to bring the main character’s heightened emotions of panic, fear, and anxiety to life, so that the audience will get to live through them as well. Then, we also analyzed “Girl” by Jamaica Kincaid and studied what the girl and second voice in the short story meant. We connected the writing to the societal standards that have been long placed on young girls and how they struggle to break out of it because they’re questions of society are quickly shot down. Our group concluded our discussion onto a single document, Speaker Analysis Chart, where we analyzed that the Point of View of “Girl” was written in was 2nd person with consciousness filled in because of the feeling that we the reader is the girl being reprimanded on how to act and that the point of view of “The Tell-Tale Heart” was 1st person so that the reader would understand the panic and confusion the character faces. Doing the chart with my group and then expanding the conversation with the class allowed me to recognize how interpretations of certain things can vary so much. For example, I had never considered the heart in “The Tell-Heart” to symbolize anything except for maybe guilt, but hearing others talk about their perspectives, such as someone mentioning that it could resemble anxiety, opened my eyes to the world of personal interpretations. This was continued in the individual readings of “LUSUS Naturae” and “The Interpreter of Maladies.” When first reading these alone, I was only able to scratch the surface of what the authors intended and what certain things meant, but as I discussed with my group, we were able to point out specific instances or aspects of the story that I hadn’t noticed before. Having people notice something new about the characters or plot, such as the symbolism of the monkeys in “The Interpreter of Maladies,” allowed me to look at the text in a new light and create completely new interpretations of the author’s meaning. Also filling out the Character analysis chart helped me recognize the importance of the supporting characters and their impact in creating the theme of the story. Despite disliking certain characters, such as the mother and sister in “LUSUS Naturae” and Mrs. Das in “The Interpreter of Maladies,” looking at every aspect of their lives the author intended to know helped me recognize that they were needed in creating the full story and message. This carried on onto our Friday Literary group talks as we read the same text, but created various meanings and important aspects of the power of text and literature. Throughout this week, I was able to learn a lot about how to look deeper into characters in order to understand their meaning and connect them to the bigger picture. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .
